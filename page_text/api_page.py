    As a user, I want to retrieve product details via an API so that I can view and analyse product information.
    \nDescription:
    The system will provide an API endpoint: 
    \n/products 
    \nthat returns a list of products. Each product includes the following details:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Product ID.</li>
            <li>Title.</li>
            <li>Price.</li>
            <li>Description.</li>
            <li>Category.</li>
            <li>Image URL.</li>
            <li>Rating Information:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rate (float): The average rating.</li>
                    <li>Count (integer): The number of ratings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    This data can be consumed by client applications to display product information or analyse product details.
    \n<b>Acceptance Criteria</b>:
    \nSuccessful Response:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>When a GET request is sent to /products, the API should return a 200 OK status.</li>
            <li>The response body should contain a JSON array of products.</li>
            <li>Each product should return the fields defined in the above description.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    Error Handling:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>If the API is accessed with an invalid HTTP method (e.g., POST), it should return a 405 Method Not Allowed status.</li>
            <li>If the API encounters an internal server error, it should return a 500 Internal Server Error status.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>      
    Validation:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>All fields in the response should match their expected data types.</li>
            <li>The image field must contain a valid URL.</li>
            <li>The rating.rate should be a float between 0.0 and 5.0.</li>
            <li>The rating.count should be a non-negative integer.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>            
    Performance:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>The API should respond within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>         
    Security:
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>API requests must only be allowed over HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>       
    What fields returned should be:
    id (integer): A unique identifier for the product.
    title (string): The name of the product.
    price (float): The price of the product.
    description (string): A brief description of the product.
    category (string): The product's category.
    image (string): A URL to the product's image.
    rating (object): Contains:
    rate (float): The average rating.
    count (integer): The number of ratings.

            \nBy analysing the user story for the "Retrieve and Display Product Information" feature, 
            I will evaluate its clarity, completeness, and testability. 
            \nThis process will help uncover any gaps or ambiguities that could lead to defects 
            during implementation or dynamic testing. 
            \nThrough this analysis, I will demonstrate how static testing can enhance the quality of deliverables by
            fostering early detection and resolution of issues.
